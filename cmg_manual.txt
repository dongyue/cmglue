What's CMGlue?
--------------

CMGlue (Configuration Management Glue) is a better git-submodule, 
to manage a workspace which may contains multiple components
that may from various version control tools such as Git and SVN (Subversion), 
or even just from a shared folder.

**Note**: currently CMGlue supports Git only.

Why CMGlue?
-----------

As best practice, all files of a project should be put into 
one repository of a version control tool, managed as a whole. 
But there are exceptions:

* Some parts are shared by multiple projects.
* Some parts are developed by another team insisting to use another version control tool.
* Some parts are rarely to change so that unnecessary to build for each time.
* Some parts has no source code but a binary from 3rd party.

As experiences from many people, these kinds of situation bring in much manual work, much time, and error-prone.
How about have a tool to manage this? Idealy, it should be able to handle:

* A workspace consists of multiple compononents from multiple repositories.
* Here the repository maybe Git's public repository, Subversion's repository, ClearCase's VOB, etc.
* Even, the repository may just means a shared folder, which always contains some binaries.
* 'Download' from the repositories, without overwrite local modifications.
* For each part, 'download' a given tag, or always 'download' the tip of a branch, automatically. 
* Know the local modifications of each part.
* 'Upload' local modifications to the repositories.
* Create and record the 'snapshot' of the whole project.
* ...

That's why CMGlue comes.

A quick tour
------------

Firstly you need to install CMGlue and creat the demo environment. 
See section Installation_ below.

Please go to the empty directory *tom* in the demo environment, and run: (On Linux)

::
    
    git clone ../remote/container.git workspace

Or on Windows:

::
    
    git clone ..\remote\container.git workspace


You have your workspace now, although it's almost empty. 
Go to the *workspace* directory and run following command to get the content::

    cmg download stream1

*stream1* is a stream of this project, which maps to branch *stream1* of the container,
branch *comp1_br1* of *component1* and tag *comp2_tag1* of *component2*. 
This command will firstly check out the branch *stream1* of the container,
and then read the stream config file *_stream* to download two components accordingly.

After you download *stream1* successfuly, in any directories of this project,
you may modify some file(s), add some new file(s), and even do some local commit(s). 
After that, you may run following command::

    cmg status

This command will report you what you have done, in the container and every components of this project.

To upload your change to public, you may run::

    cmg upload

In this demo it will just 'upload' to the *remote* directory in your demo environment, but it could be
some real public remote repositories in your real work.

Now you get some feeling about CMGlue?


.. _Installation:

Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

1. Git should be installed. Type below to verify::

(such as) *C:\\Python31\\Scripts\\cmg_create_demo.bat*,
to create a demo environement under *C:\\cmg_demo*.

Concepts
========

In the comming chapters, we will use following terms for convenience: 

- **Workspace**

  It's a local directory that includes all necessary files for a developer to develope the project.
  Typically, a workspace consists of several components' contents.
  See below for details.

- **Component**

  From CM (Configuration Management) point of view,
  a component is just a group of files and directories under one top directory that always be handled as one unit when CM operations.
  Occationally, a compnent may just be one file.
  In remote, it's stored in public repository of a version control tool or a shared place.
  In local, it locates in some place in the workspace. The user may modify its content then.

  Various version control tools:
  
  - If the component is managed in **Git**: 

    In remote, it maps to a public Git repository. 
    In local, in workspace it maps to a directory which is a Git working tree, 
    including .git directory which is a local Git repository.
  
  - If the component is managed in **SVN**:

    In remote, it maps to a SVN repository, or a directory within a SVN repository.
    In local, in workspace it maps to a directory which is a SVN working copy,
    including SVN metadata in .svn directory.
  
  - If the component is managed in **ClearCase**:

    In remote, it maps to a config spec to select contents in one or several ClearCase VOBs.
    In local, in workspace it maps to a directory which is a snapshot view with that config spec.

  - If the component is a **directory** stored in a shared folder:

    Then in local, in workspace it maps to a directory, as well as a meta-data file in parallel to describe it.
    
  - If the component is a **file** stored in a shared folder:

    Then in local, in workspace it maps to a file, as well as a meta-data file in parallel to describe it.
    
- **Container**

  A container is to contain components, while itself may quite thin: just few files always. 
  The most interesting file in container is the metadata file named *_stream* (and *_stream_\** if any), 
  which stores the information of components' configuration.
  
  In CMGlue, the container must be managed in **Git**.
  In remote, it maps to a public Git repository. 
  In local, its working tree's root is the workspace's root.

- **Stream**

  A stream is a project level 'branch', not component level.
  The configuration of a stream of a project specify for each component which branch or tag should the stream contain.
  For a component, if it's on a branch, then the user could download the tip of the branch to workspace, 
  do local modification, and then upload to public.
  For a component, if it's on a tag, then the user could download the snapshot of that tag. 

  The configuration of a stream is stored in file *_stream* (and *_stream_\** if any) in container.
  
- **Baseline**

  A baseline is a project level 'tag', not component level.
  The configuration of the baseline of a project specify for each component which tag should the baseline contain.

  The configuration of a baseline is stored in the container's tag's annotation.
  Please see Git's manual for the concept of a tag's annotation.

- **Local branch, remote-tracking branch, and branch pair**

  They are some Git special terms. It's widely used in this document as the container is under Git.
  In Git, a **local branch** is a branch in local repository and be 'owned' by local repository. 
  For example, *master*.
  While a **remote-tracking branch** is a branch in local repository but just a 'copy' of a branch in remote/public repository.
  For example, *origin/master*.
  A local branch always based on a remote-tracking branch, and follow it.
  So, here we call them a **branch pair**.
  Details please read Git documents.

  
Commands
========

cmg download
------------

Name
````
cmg download -- Download/sync/update from remote repositories/places to local.

Synopsis
````````
cmg download [-h|--help] [<tag>|<remote-tracking branch>|<local branch>]

Description
```````````
This command will download/sync/update both container and components' content 
from remote/public repositories/places to local workspace.

It will firstly sync/update the container, to a branch or tag, according to the paramater you gave,
and then it will read the stream/baseline's configuration_ stored in container,
and download/sync/update each component, to a branch or tag, according to the configuration_.

Here the word 'download' doesn't means remove all in local and re-download, 
which cost much time and may lost local modifications.
Here 'download' means sync/update the local from remote repositories.
When you download a branch, local modifications will be merged with remote changes.
While if you download a tag, you will get exactly the tag's content, with warning if you will lost local modifications.
Of course if a component does not exist yet in workspace, the 'download' will be a real download.

You may download a baseline first, and then download a stream later, that's OK.
You are free to switch among tags and streams.

Options
```````
(no paramater)
    If no paramater was given,
    CMGlue will firstly sync/update the container's current branch,
    and then read the stream's configuration, 
    and download/sync/update each component accordingly.

-h, --help
    Show help information.

<tag>
    If a tag's name was given,
    CMGlue will firstly sync/update the container to that tag,
    and then read the baseline's configuration, 
    and download/sync/update each component accordingly.

<remote-tracking branch>
    If a remote-tracking branch's name (such as *origin/master*) was given,
    CMGlue will firstly find the branch pair in container, sync/update the container on that branch pair,
    and then read the baseline's configuration, 
    and download/sync/update each component accordingly.

<local branch>
    If a local branch's name (such as *master*) was given,
    CMGlue will firstly find the branch pair in container, sync/update the container on that branch pair,
    and then read the baseline's configuration, 
    and download/sync/update each component accordingly.

Various version control tools
`````````````````````````````

- Git
  
  If the component is expected to be on a branch (branch pair in fact), 
  then CMGlue will run *git fetch*; and then *git checkout* the local branch;
  *git merge* or *git rebase* to update local branch from remote-tracking branch.
  If the component is expected to be on a tag,
  then CMGlue will run *git fetch*; and then *git checkout* the tag.
  No matter branch or tag, CMGlue will firstly check if the working tree is clean:
  No un-commited modification, no newly created file, etc.

    
cmg status
----------

Name
````
cmg status -- Show status/diff information of container and each component.

Synopsis
````````
cmg status [-h|--help] [<tag>|<remote-tracking branch>|<local branch>]

Description
```````````
This command will show the status of the container and all components' in your workspace: 
Any local modifications? How far the local 'behind' the remote? And so on.

It will firstly check the status of the container, compare it with the parameter you gave.
And then it will read stream/baseline configuration_ stored in container,
and check the status of each component, compare it with the configuration_.

It always be used before upload your modifications to public, to see what will happen. 
While it could also be used to compare two baselines/branches: *cmg download* one of them,
and then run *cmg status* with another one as paramater. 
This method could be used before merge from a baseline or another stream to current stream.

Options
```````
(no paramater)
    If no paramater was given,
    CMGlue will firstly check the container's current branch,
    and then read the stream's configuration, 
    and check each component accordingly.

-h, --help
    Show help information.

<tag>
    If a tag's name was given,
    CMGlue will firstly check the container against the tag,
    and then read the baseline's configuration, 
    and check each component accordingly against the configuration.

<remote-tracking branch>
    If a remote-tracking branch's name (such as *origin/master*) was given,
    CMGlue will firstly find the branch pair in container, check the container's status against it,
    and then read the stream's configuration (from current *_stream* and *_stream_\** file in workspace),
    and check each component accordingly against the configuration.

<local branch>
    If a local branch's name (such as *master*) was given,
    CMGlue will firstly find the branch pair in container, check the container's status against it,
    and then read the stream's configuration (from current *_stream* and *_stream_\** file in workspace),
    and check each component accordingly against the configuration.


Various version control tools
`````````````````````````````

- Git
  
  For each component under Git, CMGlue will firstly run *git fetch* and then check:
  - Is the working tree on expected branch (branch pair in fact) or tag?
  - If branch, does the remote-tracking branch have multiple local branch?
  - If branch, is the local branch ahead the remote-tracking branch? Or behind? Or diverged?
  - Is the working tree clean or not?

    
cmg upload
----------

Name
````
cmg upload -- Upload/deliver local modifications to remote repositories.

Synopsis
````````
cmg upload [-h|--help] [<tag>|<remote-tracking branch>|<local branch>]

Description
```````````
This command will upload/deliver local modifications in your workspace,
both in container and in each components, to remote repositories.

It will firstly upload modifications in all components, and finally upload modifications in container itself.
It will upload the stream/baseline configuration metadata, besides 'real modifications'.
It could upload a stream, as well as upload a baseline.
When upload a component, if it's on a branch, it will upload local modifications to the tip of the branch in remote repository.
When upload a component, if it's a tag, the behavior will depends on the type of version control tool.

Options
```````
(no paramater)
    If no paramater was given,
    CMGlue will firstly get current branch in container, 
    read current stream's configuration,
    and then upload each component accordingly.
    Finally it will upload the modifications in container.

-h, --help
    Show help information.

<tag>
    If a tag's name was given,
    CMGlue will firstly get baseline configuration according to this tag in container,
    and then upload tags in each component accordingly.
    Finally it will upload the tag in container.

<remote-tracking branch>
    If a remote-tracking branch's name (such as *origin/master*) was given,
    CMGlue will firstly check to make sure it just indicates the current branch pair.
    then read the stream's configuration,
    and then upload each component accordingly.
    Finally it will upload the modifications in container.

<local branch>
    If a local branch's name (such as *origin/master*) was given,
    CMGlue will firstly check to make sure it just indicates the current branch pair.
    then read the stream's configuration,
    and then upload each component accordingly.
    Finally it will upload the modifications in container.

Various version control tools
`````````````````````````````

- Git
  
  If in a component (or the container) it is expected to upload modifications on branch,
  then CMGlue will check to make sure it's currently on a correct branch pair,
  with clean working tree. Then CMGlue will call *git push*. 
  Please notice that *git push* could only do a fast-forward merge at remote repository.
  It means you'd better do a *cmg download* before upload.

  If in a component (or the container) it expected to upload a tag,
  then CMGlue will call *git push* to upload it.
  It means both the tag and the related history revisions will be upload, but without branch head point.

    
cmg freeze
----------

Name
````
cmg freeze -- Create baseline.

Synopsis
````````
cmg freeze -h|--help|<tag> [<old_tag>]

Description
```````````
This command will create a new baseline for the project. 

For each component, you may select an existing tag if you are on it, or create a new tag for that component.
After that, CMGlue will write out a file contain the new baseline configuration to let you review/revise.
Finally, CMGlue will create a new tag in container, with its annotation to record the baseline configuration.

Please notice this command will not upload the tag in container to remote repository, 
it means other guys can not see the baseline you just created.
(That's a good thing, isn't it?) You should call *cmg upload* if you wanna upload.

Options
```````
-h, --help
    Show help information.

<tag>
    If a tag's name was given,
    CMGlue will finally in container create this tag, which represent the new baseline.

<old_tag>
    If an old tag's name was given,
    CMGlue will use this, which indicates an old baseline, 
    as a reference when write the configuration of the new baseline: 
    In each component, CMGlue will firstly see if it's on some existing tag(s).
    If (one of) the existing tag is used to made up the old baseline,
    then it will be reused for the new baseline, instead of create new tag for that component.


Various version control tools
`````````````````````````````

- Git
  
  In a component (or the container), the new tag will be created in local repository, 
  without upload to remote repository. That means you have chance to verify them before upload.


.. _configuration:

Configurations
==============

Stream configuration
--------------------

The stream configuration is stored in file *_stream* in the root directory of the workspace 
(which also the root directory of the container). Here comes a typical one::

    [comp1]
        type = git
        url = C:\cmg_demo\remote\component1.git
        branch = origin/comp1_br1

    [folder2\comp2]
        type = git
        url = C:\cmg_demo\remote\component1.git
        tag = comp2_tag1

Each section is a component, the section name in [] is the relative path of the location of the component within the workspace.
The *type* attribute indicate the version control tool which manage this component. (Currently it support Git only.)
Other attributes are different for different version control tools. See below for details.
While generally it indicates where is the remote repository to download and upload, 
as well as whether it should follow a branch or just on a tag.

While the format of the configuration could support variables. Example below are just equal to example above::

    [DEFAULT]
        remote_root = C:\cmg_demo\remote

    [comp1]
        type = git
        url = %(remote_root)s\component1.git
        branch = origin/comp1_br1

    [folder1\comp2]
        type = git
        url = %(remote_root)s\component2.git
        tag = comp2_tag1

The *[DEFAULT]* is not a component but a section to store variable definition.


Various version control tools
`````````````````````````````

- Git
  
  - Attribute *url* should be the location of remote repository, for *git fetch*.
  - Attribute *pushurl* is optional, for *git push*. If unprovided, it will equal to *url*.
  - *branch* is the name of remote-tracking branch (such as *origin/master*) or local branch (such as *master*). Remote-tracking branch is highly recommended.
  - *tag* is a tag name. You must set either *branch* or *tag*.
        
Stream local configuration
--------------------------

The stream local configuration is stored in file *_stream_<branch>* in the root directory of the workspace.
For examle, if the container is on local branch *master* following remote-tracking branch *origin/master*,
then CMGlue will read *_stream* first, and then read *_stream_origin_master* if it exists, 
and then read *_stream_master* if it exists.

The reason for stream local configuration files is, if you do modifications on both *_stream* for some temporary purpose
and on real codes in container which is normal modifications,
then you will always want to upload your changes on real codes, but do not want to upload your changes on file *_stream*.
It's pretty tricky, so that stream local configuration files come in, instead of the modifications on stream configuration file.
Generally, stream local configuration files should not under Git's version control, to reduce the accidents to commit/upload them.

The format of stream local configuration is as same as stream configuration.
The value in it will add to or overwrite the stream configuration.
While it's unnessesary to restatement everything in local configuration, just some special ones to add/change are enough.


Baseline configuration
----------------------

The baseline configuration is stored in the container's tags' annotations. 
Please see Git documents for the meanning of tag's annotation.

The format of baseline configuration is as same as stream configuration.
While generally each component should always on a tag/snapshot, not on a branch / floating point.

During the baseline creation via *cmg freeze* command, 
CMGlue will put your new baseline's configuration into file *_baseline* in *.git* directory in your container.
You may review and revise it before the creation of the tag in container.

Content of .gitignore
---------------------

Below is a typical *.gitignore* file in your container::

    _stream_*

    comp1
    folder1/comp2

The first part is to ignore stream local configuration files such as *_stream_master*.
It helps you to modify stream configuration locally and temporarily, with out publish it.
(It will not ignore stream configuration file *_stream* which should under version control.)
The second part is to ignore components the container contain.
It should always be */* **not** *\\* to separate path, even on Windows.

BTW, you may probably want to add other patterns to *.gitignore* file in container and each component. 
Such as *\*.bak* and *\*.orig*.

CMGlue configuration
--------------------

CMGlue itself has some configuration variables which have their default values (in file *common.py* if you are interested).
You may change their values to change the behavour of CMGlue. They are:

*verbose*
    Default value is *False*. If set to *True*, the output of CMGlue command will contains much more details.

*gitrebase*
    Default value is *True*. If set to *False*, when download a component/container under Git, 
    CMGlue will call *git merge* instead of *git rebase*, to fresh local branch from remote-tracking branch.

*online*
    Default value is *True*. If set to *False*, CMGlue will not communicate with remote repositories.
    For example, for *cmg download*, in a component/container under Git, CMGlue will not call *git fetch*,
    but could still switch among tags/branches stored in Git local repository.

To change these variable's values, of course you may just modify CMGlue's source code, 
while geneally you should modify them in configuration files. CMGlue stores these variables within Git configuration files.
It could be: *$GIT_DIR/config* in container, or *~/.gitconfig* which is user-specific configuration file,
or *$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig* which is system-wide configuration file. 
Please see Git documents especially *git config* for details.

Below is a typical CMGlue configuration section in a Git configuration file::

    [cmg]
        verbose = true
        gitrebase = true
        online = true

You needn't specify all variables here. Any one you do not specify will just be the default value.


Global variables
----------------

In the beginning of CMGlue source code file *common.py*, there are two global variables you may be interested in:

*STREAMFILE = "_stream"*
    The file in root of container which stores the stream configuration.

*BASELINEFILE = "_baseline"*
    It's a temporary file in .git directory in container generated by *cmg freeze* to store the baseline configuration
    for user to review and revise.
    Finally *cmg freeze* will use this file's content to create tag's annotation to record baseline.


.. _SOP:

Standard Operating Procedure
============================

Even if you have a SOP (Standard Operating Procedure), please be flexible in a balanced way, 
to fit for your business need case by case.

Below we will describe the most frequent procedures, with demo. 
To be simple enough, in the demo, all Git repositories, no matter remote or local,
will be under a common local directory. Say,

- *~/cmg_demo/remote* for remote repositories,
- *~/cmg_demo/cm* for the CM engineer's local repositories,
- *~/cmg_demo/tom* for developer Tom's local repositories, etc.

This demo is for Linux and Windows. The major differents are:

- In path name: slash '*/*' on Linux while back slash '*\\*' on Windows.
- The root of demo environment: *~/cmg_demo/* on Linux and *C:\\cmg_demo\\* on Windows.
- To create an empty file: *touch a_file* on Linux and *type nul > a_file* on Windows.

CM create the project
---------------------

1. Prerequisites: There are Git remote repositories for components: (on Linux)

::

    mkdir ~/cmg_demo
    cd ~/cmg_demo
    mkdir remote
    mkdir cm
    mkdir tom
    
    cd remote
    git init --bare component1.git
    cd ../cm
    git clone ~\cmg_demo\remote\component1.git component1
    cd component1
    git commit --allow-empty -m "init"
    git push origin HEAD:master
    git push origin HEAD:comp1_br1
    git fetch
    git checkout -b comp1_br1 origin/comp1_br1
    echo 1st in component 1 > component1.txt
    git add .
    git commit -m "1st in component 1"
    git push
    cd ..\..
    
    cd remote
    git init --bare component2.git
    cd ../cm

    cd ..\..
    
    cd remote
    git init --bare component2.git
    cd ..\cm
    git clone C:\cmg_demo\remote\component2.git component2
    cd component2
    git commit --allow-empty -m "init"
    git push origin HEAD:master
    git push origin HEAD:comp2_br1
    git fetch
    git checkout -b comp2_br1 origin/comp2_br1
    echo 1st in component 2 > component2.txt
    git add .
    git commit -m "1st in component 2"
    git push
    git tag comp2_tag1
    git push --tags
    cd ..\..

    
Commands above created two components. *component1* has a branch named *comp1_br1*,
*component2* has a branch named *comp2_br1*, as well as a tag named *comp2_tag1*.

Tip 1: You need a *master* branch on remote repository, 
or later you will meet several trouble as you don't have this default branch.

2. Create remote repository as well as local repository for container. Create and checkout a branch acting as a stream: (On Linux)

::

    cd remote
    git init --bare container.git
    cd ../cm
    git clone ~/cmg_demo/remote/container.git workspace
    cd workspace
    touch _stream
    git add .
    git commit -m "init"
    git push origin HEAD:master
    git push origin HEAD:stream1
    git fetch
    git checkout -b stream1 origin/stream1
    
Or on Windows:

::    

    cd remote
    git init --bare container.git
    cd ..\cm
    git clone C:\cmg_demo\remote\container.git workspace
    cd workspace
    type nul > _stream
    git add .
    git commit -m "init"
    git push origin HEAD:master
    git push origin HEAD:stream1
    git fetch
    git checkout -b stream1 origin/stream1


Commands above created *container.git* as component, and cloned it to *workspace* acting as workspace.
Currently it's on branch *stream1* acting as a stream.

Tip 1: You need a *_stream* file on *master* branch at very begining, 
otherwise later developer who just cloned the container can not run CMGlue because of CMGlue can not find *_stream* on default checkout branch *master*.

3. In workspace, modify *_stream* file to include your components: (on Linux)

::

    [DEFAULT]
        remote_root = ~/cmg_demo/remote 
    
    [comp1]
        type = git
        url = %(remote_root)s/component1.git
        branch = origin/comp1_br1
    
    [folder1/comp2]
        type = git
        url = %(remote_root)s/component2.git
        tag = comp2_tag1

Or on Windows:

::    

    [DEFAULT]
        remote_root = C:\cmg_demo\remote 
    
    [comp1]
        type = git
        url = %(remote_root)s\component1.git
        branch = origin/comp1_br1
    
    [folder1\comp2]
        type = git
        url = %(remote_root)s\component2.git
        tag = comp2_tag1


So, the stream will select branch *comp1_br1* in *component1*, as well as tag *comp2_tag1* in *component2*.

4. Create/modify .gitignore file, to ignore components as well as stream configuration files:

::    

    echo _stream_*>>.gitignore
    echo comp1>>.gitignore
    echo folder1/comp2>>.gitignore
    
So, stream local configuration file such as *_stream_stream1* (which does not exist yet) will be ignored by Git version control.
And the two component's working tree will be ignored by Git version control in the container.

Tip 1: If on Windows, don't add any space before *>>*, or *.gitignore* will contain space at the end of each line that Git can not understand.

Tip 2: On Windows GUI you can not create/rename a file with file name start from a ., such as *.gitignore*.
As showed above, you may create the file from command line.

5. Run *cmg download* to have a test. Skip (option 3) the warning that your container is not clean:

::    

    cmg download

Browsing the workspace, you could see the 2 components.

6. Run *cmg status* to check current status:

::    

    cmg status

You could see you have 2 files (*.gitignore* and *_stream*) to commit to local repository of the container.

7. Run *cmg upload* to upload, including commit your newly created files to Git local repository firstly:

::    

    cmg upload

8. Run *cmg freeze* to create a initial baseline:

::

    cmg freeze baseline1

9. Run *cmg upload* to upload this baseline:

::    

    cmg upload baseline1

    
Finished.    
    
Developer initializes his environment
-------------------------------------

1. Clone the remote repository of container to local: (On Linux)

::

    cd ~/cmg_demo/tom
    git clone ../remote/container.git workspace
    cd workspace

Or on Windows:

::

    cd C:\cmg_demo\tom
    git clone ..\remote\container.git workspace
    cd workspace



2. Run *cmg download* to download components.

::

    cmg download stream1


Developer's daily work
----------------------

1. Run *cmg download* to update workspace: (On Linux)

::

    cd ~/cmg_demo/tom/workspace
    cmg download

Or on Windows:

::

    cd C:\cmg_demo\tom\workspace
    cmg download

2. Develope, review, unit test ...

::

    echo modify in container >> container.txt
    cd comp
    echo modify in component1 >> component1.txt

3. Run *cmg download* to update workspace, including commit your modifications to local repository firstly if any.

::
    
    cmg download
    
4. Build and smoke test.

5. Run *cmg upload* to upload, including commit your modifications to local repository firstly if any.

::    

    cmg upload


CM setup continuous integration
-------------------------------

The CI (continuous integration) tool should monitor both the container's and all components' corresponding branches.
When any change is detected, the CI tool should:

1. Run *cmg download* to get last minute update.

2. Build and smoke test.


CM create baseline
------------------

1. Run *cmg download* to get the last content: (On Linux)

::

    cd ~/cmg_demo/cm/workspace
    cmg download

Or on Windows:

::

    cd C:\cmg_demo\cm\workspace
    cmg download

2. Build and test.

3. Run *cmg baseline* to create the baseline, based on previous.

::

    cmg freeze baseline2 baseline1

4. Run *cmg upload* to upload the baseline.

::

    cmg upload baseline2


Developer/CM merge from baseline or another stream
--------------------------------------------------

1. Run *cmg download* to get the content of the stream to merge to: (On Linux)

::

    cd ~/cmg-demo/cm/workspace
    cmg download stream1

Or on Windows:

::

    cd C:\cmg-demo\cm\workspace
    cmg download stream1


2. Run *cmg status* to compare the source baseline/stream and target stream.

::

    cmg status baseline1

3. For container and each component, merge from source tag/branch to target branch if necessary.

::

    (git merge/rebase ...)

4. Build and test.

5. Run *cmg upload* to upload.

::

   cmg upload

   
To develope/extend CMGlue
=========================

- Hosting

  The source codes of CMGlue itself is stored in http://github.com/dongyue/cmglue under Git. 
  Your may clone the repository to start your work.

- Documentation

  This document (in html) is generated from *cmg_manual.txt*, via tool Docutils: (On Unix)

::  
    rst2html cmg_manual.txt cmg_manual.html

Or on Windows it is:

::

    rst2html.py cmg_manual.txt cmg_manual.html
  
See http://docutils.sourceforge.net/ for details.

- Packaging

  The file *build.py* may give you some hint. 
  Details about packaging in Python pls see http://docs.python.org/py3k/distutils/index.html.
  
- Add another VC tool

  To add another version control tool (for example, iVer which doesn't exist in this world) to CMGlue to support, 
  you need to do following modifications:

  - In file *commands.py*, take care of lines similar to::

        if type.lower() == 'git':
            git.xxxxxx(xxxxxx)

    Add corresponding lines for iVer.

  - In a new file *iver.py*, you write all details.

  - Modify the *cmg_manual.txt*, for *component* section, and all sections under name *Various version control tools*.
